# Maze of Waze - The game

This project is Extention of ["OopEx2-Maze-of-Waze"](https://github.com/NetanelAlbert/OopEx2-Maze-of-Waze).
I used the graph and the algorithms to create a game somewhat alike [Pac-Man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pac-Man).

In this game you can choose scenerio from 24 that the "server" have.
Than you need to choose if you want yo play manually or let the compiuter play.

In the end of each game you can save it to a KML log file and [open](https://support.google.com/earth/answer/7365595?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en) it in [Google Earth](https://www.google.com/intl/iw/earth/).

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites
- [JDK-11.0.4](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk13-downloads-5672538.html)
- [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/) or some other IDE (recommended)
- [Google Earth](https://www.google.com/intl/iw/earth/versions/) (recommended, to open kml files)
